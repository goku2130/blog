A data nerd with a penchant for applying AI for product development/improvements.

I have a proven experience in bringing to life the machine learning solutions from just jupyter notebooks that deliver value to the business.

During my free time, I love to prove to some naive Lichess subjects as to why 1.b3 (Cowboy attack) is the best opening move (p>0.05) in chess.
Also, I like building and breaking products on the cloud (literally) and a big fan of the Chaos Monkey culture.

We build it, we break it, we fix it, we learn it, we repeat it!
