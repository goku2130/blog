# Statistical Foundations for A/B Testing: From Basic Principles to Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches

## Introduction

A/B testing is a powerful tool in the arsenal of data-driven decision making. To truly harness its potential, it's crucial to understand the statistical foundations that underpin this methodology. This blog post will guide you through the essential statistical concepts, from basic principles to the more advanced frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

## 1. Basic Statistical Concepts

### Population vs. Sample

In statistics, we often work with samples to make inferences about populations. Let's illustrate this concept with Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a population
population = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=15, size=100000)

# Take a sample
sample = np.random.choice(population, size=1000, replace=False)

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(population, bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Population')
plt.hist(sample, bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Sample')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Population vs Sample')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

print(f"Population mean: {population.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Sample mean: {sample.mean():.2f}")
```

This code creates a population with a normal distribution and takes a random sample from it. The histogram shows how the sample distribution approximates the population distribution.

### Probability Distributions

Understanding probability distributions is crucial for A/B testing. The normal distribution is particularly important:

```python
from scipy import stats

x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, stats.norm.pdf(x, 0, 1))
plt.title('Standard Normal Distribution')
plt.xlabel('z-score')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.show()
```

This code plots the standard normal distribution, which is fundamental to many statistical tests used in A/B testing.

## 2. Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is the backbone of A/B testing. Let's break down the key components:

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses

In A/B testing, we typically set up hypotheses like:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between A and B.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference between A and B.

### p-values and Significance Levels

The p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Let's simulate this:

```python
# Simulate two groups
group_a = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)
group_b = np.random.normal(102, 15, 1000)

# Perform t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_a, group_b)

print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

If the p-value is less than our chosen significance level (often 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

## 3. Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is crucial in understanding why many A/B testing methods work. Let's visualize it:

```python
sample_means = []
for _ in range(1000):
    sample = np.random.choice(population, size=30, replace=True)
    sample_means.append(sample.mean())

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(sample_means, bins=50)
plt.title('Distribution of Sample Means')
plt.xlabel('Sample Mean')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

print(f"Mean of sample means: {np.mean(sample_means):.2f}")
print(f"Population mean: {population.mean():.2f}")
```

This demonstrates how the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution, even when the underlying population is not normally distributed.

## 4. Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter:

```python
sample = np.random.choice(population, size=100, replace=False)
sample_mean = np.mean(sample)
sample_std = np.std(sample, ddof=1)
confidence_interval = stats.t.interval(alpha=0.95, df=len(sample)-1,
                                       loc=sample_mean,
                                       scale=stats.sem(sample))

print(f"95% Confidence Interval: {confidence_interval}")
```

This calculates a 95% confidence interval for the mean of our sample.

## 5. The Frequentist Approach to A/B Testing

The frequentist approach, which is traditional in A/B testing, relies on p-values and significance levels. Here's a simple A/B test using this approach:

```python
# Simulate click-through rates for two versions
version_a = np.random.binomial(1, 0.1, 1000)
version_b = np.random.binomial(1, 0.12, 1000)

# Perform chi-square test
contingency_table = [[version_a.sum(), len(version_a) - version_a.sum()],
                     [version_b.sum(), len(version_b) - version_b.sum()]]
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

print(f"Chi-square statistic: {chi2:.4f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

This example uses a chi-square test to compare click-through rates between two versions.

## 6. Introduction to Bayesian Approach

The Bayesian approach differs from the frequentist by incorporating prior beliefs and updating them with observed data. Here's a simple Bayesian A/B test:

```python
from scipy.stats import beta

def bayesian_ab_test(a_conversions, a_trials, b_conversions, b_trials, samples=100000):
    a_posterior = beta.rvs(a_conversions + 1, a_trials - a_conversions + 1, size=samples)
    b_posterior = beta.rvs(b_conversions + 1, b_trials - b_conversions + 1, size=samples)
    
    prob_b_better = (b_posterior > a_posterior).mean()
    
    return prob_b_better

# Example usage
prob_b_better = bayesian_ab_test(120, 1000, 140, 1000)
print(f"Probability that B is better than A: {prob_b_better:.4f}")

# Visualize posteriors
a_posterior = beta.rvs(121, 881, size=10000)
b_posterior = beta.rvs(141, 861, size=10000)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(a_posterior, bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='A')
plt.hist(b_posterior, bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='B')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Posterior Distributions')
plt.xlabel('Conversion Rate')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

This Bayesian approach gives us a probability that one version is better than the other, rather than a binary significant/not significant result.

## Conclusion

Understanding these statistical foundations is crucial for effectively implementing and interpreting A/B tests. While the frequentist approach is more commonly used due to its simplicity and established methodologies, the Bayesian approach offers a more nuanced interpretation of results, especially useful in scenarios with prior information or when continuous monitoring is needed.

As you delve deeper into A/B testing, remember that these statistical tools are means to an end - making better, data-driven decisions. Always consider the practical significance of your results alongside their statistical significance.
